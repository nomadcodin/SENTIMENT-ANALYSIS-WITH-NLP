This project built a sentiment analysis system to classify Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using NLP techniques. The pipeline began with text preprocessing: cleaning raw reviews by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, eliminating stopwords, and applying lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms. We then transformed the text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which weights words by their importance in each document relative to their frequency across all documents.

A Logistic Regression classifier was trained on these features, achieving around 90% accuracy. The model learned to associate certain words (e.g., "excellent," "terrible") with sentiment polarity. We also analyzed feature importance to identify the most influential words for positive/negative predictions. The system was tested on custom reviews to demonstrate real-time classification.

Sentiment analysis has widespread applications in business intelligence, including brand monitoring (tracking customer opinions on social media), market research (analyzing product feedback), and customer service automation (prioritizing negative reviews for follow-up). The project highlights how simple ML models can deliver powerful insights when combined with effective feature engineering. Implemented in Google Colab, it showcases an end-to-end NLP workflow from raw text to deployable model.
